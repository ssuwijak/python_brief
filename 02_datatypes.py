'''
Python has five standard data types âˆ’

Numbers : int, long (oct||hex), float, complex
String
List : [] similar to collection in C#
Tuple : innit by () but access by [index] Tuples can be thought of as read-only lists. (no resize & no change)
Dictionary : init by {} but assigned/accessed by [key]  hash of key-value
