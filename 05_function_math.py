Constant
pi = The mathematical constant pi.
e = The mathematical constant e.


1	abs(x)
The absolute value of x: the (positive) distance between x and zero.

2	ceil(x)
The ceiling of x: the smallest integer not less than x

3	cmp(x, y)
-1 if x < y, 0 if x == y, or 1 if x > y

4	exp(x)
The exponential of x: ex

5	fabs(x)
The absolute value of x.

6	floor(x)
The floor of x: the largest integer not greater than x

7	log(x)
The natural logarithm of x, for x> 0

8	log10(x)
The base-10 logarithm of x for x> 0.

9	max(x1, x2,...)
The largest of its arguments: the value closest to positive infinity

10	min(x1, x2,...)
The smallest of its arguments: the value closest to negative infinity

11	modf(x)
The fractional and integer parts of x in a two-item tuple. Both parts have the same sign as x. The integer part is returned as a float.

12	pow(x, y)
The value of x**y.

13	round(x [,n])
x rounded to n digits from the decimal point. Python rounds away from zero as a tie-breaker: round(0.5) is 1.0 and round(-0.5) is -1.0.

14	sqrt(x)
The square root of x for x > 0
